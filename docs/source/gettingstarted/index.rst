First Steps
###############

To compute in Apolo it is necessary to take into account several considerations. In this section you will find which are
the minimum conditions to be able to compute on the clusters of the center and what is the procedure to do it.

How to apply for computing time on Apolo
========================================

The first contact to evaluate the viability of computing in Apolo is by means of an email to apolo@eafit.edu.co or a
call +57 (4) 2619592. An appointment will be scheduled via physical or virtual to assess the needs of the user.
At Apolo, researchers from the Universidad EAFIT can compute for free. Other universities, academic institutions or
industrial companies can compute, applying costs on the *core-hour*  basis.


Prerrequisites on the software
==============================

The following items describes the ideal technical conditions of the software to compute on Apolo's supercomputers.

#. Scientific Software
#. Linux compatible
#. Already parallel or parallelizable
#. Distributed (Highly recommended)

If you answer affirmatively the previous questions then you are a good candidate to compute in Apolo. The next step is
to schedule an appointment to make the following verifications:

#. Your software is installed and ready to use it or we have to install it.
#. Your software is optimized and configured in a proper way or we have to reconfigure it.
#. You are already trained or need to be guided to use Apolo in a proper way.

Once all this things were analyzed, we can proceed to create the account on the clusters.

Get an account
==============

To use Apolo you will need to have the following items:

- A VPN Account, created by the system administrators. In the following sections you will find a tutorial tu configure
the VPN account in different operating systems.
- An Account on Apolo's clusters, created by system administrators
- Test if your accounts are working and launch a job!
