First Steps
###############

To compute in Apolo it is necessary to take into account several considerations. In this section you will find what are the minimum conditions to be able to compute on the clusters of the center and what is the procedure to do it.

How to apply for computing time on Apolo
========================================

The first contact to evaluate the viability of computing in Apolo is by means of an email to apolo@eafit.edu.co or a call +57 (4) 2619592. An appointment will be scheduled via physical or virtual to assess the needs of the user. At Apolo, researchers from the Universidad EAFIT and other universities or academic or industrial institutions can compute, applying costs on the *core-hour* for external users to EAFIT University.



Prerrequisites on the software
==============================

The following 

#. Your software is used for scientific computing?
#. Your software works on Linux?
#. Your software is parallel?
#. Your software is distributed?

If you answer affirmatively the previous questions then you are a good candidate to compute in Apolo. The next step is to schedule a
